Python is a unique language. It is powerful enough to used in places like NASA, Wall Street, and the Large Hadron
Collider to do things like render the first image of a black hole and discover new particles.

Yet it's syntax is simple enough that it is used in elementary schools to teach students to program.

This imbalance of readability and power is one aspect that is contributing to python's rise in popularity.
But how can that be, after all,

Python is not as fast as C. It is not in all the same environments that JavaScript is in.
It's too big to fit on board most embedded chips.

And yet it beat out C developers in creating an online platform (YouTube).
People are bringing it to the browser it's getting put on development boards (Circuit Playground Express).

# Python is not the best language at doing any one thing. 
# But the moment you want to do more than one thing, Python quickly rises to the top.

The python ecosystem is large, and it gives anyone the ability to download software that can empower your project
to capture data, analyze and graph it, and deploy it to a web server, without having to change languages.

It is this attribute of python that we'd like to show you today.
